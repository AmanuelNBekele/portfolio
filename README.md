**2D Visualization and Analysis of Electronic Tabular Data with RST in Cybersecurity Using Python**
- Implemented two Matplotlib tasks for data visualization in Python
- Created scatter plots and histograms for columns of information
- Demonstrated the use of plt.errorbar() for graphing uncertainties on data points
- Introduced plt.scatter() for color-coded 2D graphs based on a third quantity ('label' column)

### Work Experience

**Technical Assistant Intern @ TAB USA LLC (April 2024 - Present)**
- Develop Microsoft Access databases for tracking battery serial numbers, matching a potential customer’s forklift to the appropriate battery, and managing forklift companies, customer details, call-backs, and quotes for the sales department
- Write VBA script & SQL queries for production scheduling to interface with Microsoft Access Databases
- Support plant IT operations
  
**Electronic Technician Apprentice @ Garmin Ltd (February 2021 - April 2021)**
