### Projects

**Route-Finding Algorithm Implementation and Analysis Using Python**
- Implemented and compared five route-finding algorithms—undirected brute-force, breadth-first search, depth-first search, ID-DFS search, and heuristic approaches—using a dataset of small towns in southern Kansas
- Program prompts users to input starting and ending towns, select a search method, and then print the discovered route along with relevant metrics such as total time, distance, and optional memory usage

**Employee Management System Using C++**
- Established an Employee Management System utilizing object-oriented programming principles to store employee information to calculate salary, health contributions, and vacation days earned
- Program features a suite of member functions mirroring standard list operations, including push_front, push_back, pop_front, pop_back, front, back, empty, insert, remove, and find

**2D Visualization and Analysis of Electronic Tabular Data with RST in Cybersecurity Using Python**
- Implemented two Matplotlib tasks for data visualization in Python
- Created scatter plots and histograms for columns of information
- Demonstrated the use of plt.errorbar() for graphing uncertainties on data points
- Introduced plt.scatter() for color-coded 2D graphs based on a third quantity ('label' column)

### Work Experience

**Electronic Technician Apprentice @ Garmin Ltd (February 2021 - April 2021)**
- Constructed, fine-tuned, and validated a transistor tester
- Enrolled in and actively engaged in technician training sessions
- Communicated research outcomes and insights concerning the transistor tester through informative presentations

**Technical Assistant Intern @ TAB USA LLC (April 2024 - Present)**
